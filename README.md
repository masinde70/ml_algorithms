## Types of 2D Imaging Algorithms 
1. Classification
   The classification algorithm assesses a whole image and returns an output stating whether or not a disease or abnormality is present in an image. These types of algorithms can be used for binary or multi-class classification, where a single algorithm can classify for the presence or absence of multiple types of findings or diseases
