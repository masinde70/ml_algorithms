## Types of 2D Imaging Algorithms 
1. Classification
   The classification algorithm assesses a whole image and returns an output stating whether or not a disease or abnormality is present in an image. These types of algorithms can be used for binary or multi-class classification, where a single algorithm can classify for the presence or absence of multiple types of findings or diseases

2. Localization
Localization algorithms are intended to aid radiologists in determining where in an image a particular finding is. These types of algorithms output a set of coordinates that create a bounding box around a section of the image where a particular type of finding is. These types of algorithms can be very useful for drawing radiologists' attention to certain types of findings that are difficult to see on imaging.

3. Segmentation
